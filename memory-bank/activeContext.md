# Active Context: VODlibrary (2025-05-26)

## Current Focus
Finalizing Open Graph Protocol metadata implementation and general codebase cleanup.

## Recent Changes (2025-05-26)
- **Open Graph Protocol Metadata**: Comprehensive implementation for Discord embeds, including `og:title`, `og:type`, `og:image` (absolute URL), `og:url`, `og:description`, `og:site_name`, and `og:video` (with `type`, `secure_url`, `width`, `height`). This involved:
    - Adding `prefix="og: https://ogp.me/ns#"` to `<html>` tag in `public/player.html`.
    - Updating database schema (`videos` table) with `width` and `height` columns.
    - Modifying `lib/scanner.js` to extract video dimensions using `ffprobe` and store them.
    - Moving `/watch/:id` (video page) and `/api/videos/:id/stream` (video stream) routes before authentication middleware in `server.js` to ensure public accessibility for scrapers.
    - Reordering middleware in `server.js` to ensure static assets and `/api/config` are publicly accessible.
    - Removing duplicate `/api/config` route in `server.js`.
    - Removing debugging logs from `server.js`.
- **Authentication Flow Fix**: Corrected middleware order in `server.js` to ensure `index.html` is protected by authentication, while still allowing necessary public routes.
- **URL Session Key Authentication**: Implemented a dedicated route to handle session key in URL path, setting authentication cookie and redirecting to clean URL.
- **Memory Bank Optimization**: Streamlined `progress.md` from verbose verification lists to concise status summary.
- **Scrolling Performance**: Optimized infinite scroll thresholds and batch sizes for better responsiveness.
- **Middle Mouse/Ctrl+Click**: Implemented native `<a>` element approach for new tab functionality.
- **UI Fixes**: Removed accidental comment display, improved favorite indicator alignment.
- **Share Link with Session Key**: Modified share link generation to include the `SESSION_KEY` from `.env` for enhanced security. **Fixed regression where share link API route was missing.**

## Current Task Status
- ‚úÖ Open Graph Protocol Metadata fully implemented and verified.
- ‚úÖ URL Session Key Authentication implemented.
- ‚úÖ Progress.md optimized.
- ‚úÖ Share Link with Session Key implemented.
- ‚úÖ Codebase reviewed for duplicates and unnecessary logging.
- ‚úÖ Authentication Flow Fix implemented.
- üîÑ ActiveContext.md optimization (in progress).
- ‚è≥ Pending: Implement optional access token functionality.
- ‚è≥ Pending: Adjust video player UI.


## Key System State
- All core features functional and stable.
- Authentication, real-time updates, and player features working.
- Performance optimizations recently implemented.
- System ready for further development.

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank optimization.
2. Update `README.md` with new dependencies.
3. Implement `ENABLE_AUTH` environment variable and update `checkAuth` middleware.
4. Validate URL Session Key Authentication functionality.
5. Clean up unused code and comments.
6. Validate system functionality after cleanup.
7. Adjust video player UI as per user request.
