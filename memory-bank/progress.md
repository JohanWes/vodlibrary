# Progress: VODlibrary

## Current Status
All core features are fully functional and stable, including comprehensive Open Graph Protocol metadata for Discord embeds.

## Core Features Working
- **Open Graph Protocol Metadata**: Fully implemented for rich Discord embeds, including `og:title`, `og:type`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:description`, `og:site_name`, and `og:video` with dimensions. Routes for video pages and streams are publicly accessible for scrapers.
- **Video Library**: Scanning, multiple directory support, thumbnail generation, streaming, pagination, and real-time updates.
- **Authentication**: Session key-based access with HTTP-only cookies, including URL-based session key support. Authentication flow fixed to correctly protect `index.html`.
- **Player Features**: Death markers, outcome indicators, favorites, and share links (functionality restored).
- **UI/UX**: Smooth scrolling, responsive design, and middle-click new tab functionality.
- **Database**: SQLite with indexing for performance.
- **Sorting**: By date added (newest/oldest).
- **Video Formats**: Wide range of supported formats.

## Technical Implementation
- Node.js/Express.js backend with SQLite database.
- `chokidar` for file system monitoring and `Server-Sent Events` for real-time updates.
- Client-side caching and preloading, with HTTP caching for static assets.
- CDN integration support.
- `fluent-ffmpeg` for video metadata extraction.

## Known Issues
- MP4 permission error for specific file (requires user action).
- Server restart still required for `SESSION_KEY` changes in `.env` (URL-based key is a workaround).

## Next Steps
- Implement optional access token functionality.
- Adjust video player UI.
- General code cleanup and maintenance.
- Performance monitoring.
